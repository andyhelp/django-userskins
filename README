The initial design of django-userskins is roughly based
on this email sent to [Yashh](http://yashh.com].

Yashh,

Using django-chunks is an interesting idea, but (if feasible) I'd like to do it without injecting css into the html documents (don't have to resend the CSS with each page, which will cut down on bandwidth and http requests).

Here is my rough idea (I'm not sure how good it is yet ;):

1. Create a model like this:

   class SkinPreference(models.Model):
       user = models.ForeignKey(User)
       skin = models.CharField(max_length=20)

2. Create a view that lets users select a skin preference:

   @login_required
   def select_skin(request):
       if request.POST.has_key("skin"):
           SkinPreference.objects.create(user=request.user, skin=request.POST["skin"])
           return HttpResponse(u"Selected skin %s" % request.POST["skin"])
       else:
           return HttpResponseServerError(u"Did not POST the 'skin' key.")

2. Create a context processor SkinContext that will handle determining the correct skin for the current user. To avoid adding an extra database request each time, we'll only hit the database if the user is authenticated (non-authenticated users can't have a skin preference, and will always get default), and we'll try to store the selected skin in a cookie if possible

   def process_request(self, request):
       context = {}
       if request.user.is_anonymous():
           context['skin'] = "default"
      else:
           if request.COOKIES.has_key("skin"):
              context['skin'] = request.COOKIES["skin"]
           else:
               try:
                   skin = SkinPreference.objects.get(user=request.user).skin
               except SkinPreference.ObjectDoesNotExist:
                   skin = "default"
                request.COOKIES["skin"] = skin
                context['skin'] = skin
       return context


3. In the templates do something like this:

   {% ifequal skin "default" %}
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/media/default_skin.css">
   {% endifequal %}
   {% ifequal skin "blue" %}
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/media/blue_skin.css">
   {% endifequal %}

That is a bit ugly, but what I *really* want to do is to combine it with django-compress, and write code like this:

   {% load compressed %}
   {% ifequal skin "default" %}
   {% compressed_css "default" %}
   {% endifequal %}
   {% ifequal skin "blue" %}
   {% compressed_css "blue" %}
   {% endifequal %}

That would allow skins to be cached just as easily as the default CSS (and django-compress would make it easy to add far-future expires, so that the users will never even have to request the skin files).

This seems like an elegant solution to me... any thoughts? I'll try to put something up on github tomorrow, and we can collaborate if we have both ideas and time. ;)
