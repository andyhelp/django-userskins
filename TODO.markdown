## TODO TASKS

1.  Can we create a flexible general purpose view to
    handle the process of assigning users a skin.
    Essentially that involves a) setting a cookie in
    the response, and b) create a SkinPreference instance
    for the user and skin.

2.  Test that the integration with django-compress
    actually works (pretty sure it does ;).
